# Invert GIF Maker

A lightweight, browser-based tool that takes any image and generates an animated GIF that flickers between the original and its color-inverted version — no server, no upload, no dependencies beyond a single JS library.

## What it does

1. You upload a local image (PNG, JPG, WebP, etc.)
2. The tool instantly generates the color-inverted version in the browser
3. A live preview shows the flicker effect before you commit
4. You adjust the delay between frames using a slider
5. Hit **Generate & Download GIF** — a 2-frame animated GIF downloads automatically

---

## Features

- Works entirely in the browser — nothing is uploaded anywhere
- Live preview updates in real time as you move the slider
- Adjustable frame delay from 100 ms to 2000 ms
- Displays image dimensions after upload
- Progress bar during GIF encoding
- Auto-downloads the finished GIF and cleans up memory
- Button re-enables after each export so you can regenerate at a different speed

## Files

```
index.html   — the entire tool (single self-contained file)
```

gif.js encodes in Web Workers. If you host this yourself, make sure `gif.worker.js` is served from the same directory as `gif.js`, or the encoding step will silently fail.

---

## Browser support

Any modern browser with support for:
- HTML5 Canvas (`getContext("2d")`)
- Web Workers
- `URL.createObjectURL`

Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

---

## Local setup

No build step needed. Just serve the file over HTTP (not `file://` — Web Workers require a server origin):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080

# Node.js (npx)
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.
